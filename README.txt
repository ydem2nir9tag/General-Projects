word.exe is the executable program.  It looks for a dictionary file named
dictionary.txt in the same folder.  We're providing one with about 110,000 words.
If you want to try running with a smaller dictionary, rename our big dictionary.txt
to something else, and copy your smaller dictionary to dictionary.txt.  Alternatively,
you can load a new dictionary into the editor with the CTRL-D command.

We're also providing some text files to edit or various sizes:  civildis.txt (1KB),
threemen.txt (382KB), and warandpeace.txt (3.3MB).  If you run wurd from the command
line, you can give the file to edit as an argument.  Otherwise, you can load the file
with the Ctrl-L command in the editor.
